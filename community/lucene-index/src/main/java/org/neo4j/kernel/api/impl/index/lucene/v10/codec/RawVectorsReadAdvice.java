/// Applies [ReadAdvice#RANDOM] to the raw float32 vectors (`.vec`) and to nothing else.
///
/// `MADV_RANDOM` buys the loss of the kernel's fault-around readahead. That is a bad trade for the
/// HNSW graph (`.vex`) and the quantized codes (`.veq`) -- both are small enough to stay resident
/// and have to warm up quickly -- and a good one for `.vec`: binary quantization touches it only
/// while rescoring, one unrelated vector at a time, and on a large index it is far too big to hold
/// in the page cache, so readahead there reads 16-32 pages to use one and evicts the graph doing it.
///
/// Selecting only `.vec` is the whole difficulty. [MMapDirectory#setReadAdvice] is keyed on the file
/// name, and inside a compound segment -- the default layout, since
/// `internal.dbms.index.lucene.nocfs.ratio` is 1.0 -- the only name the directory is ever handed is
/// the container's `.cfs`, so a name predicate silently matches nothing. Lucene's own
/// [org.apache.lucene.store.DataAccessHint] does not discriminate either: `.vex`, `.veq` and `.vec`
/// are all opened with [org.apache.lucene.store.DataAccessHint#RANDOM], so honouring it advises all
/// three.
///
/// So the file is marked instead of matched. [#markRawVectors] wraps the directory a reader opens
/// its files through and tags `.vec` -- and only `.vec` -- with a private hint; [#READ_ADVICE], which
/// the directory factory installs, turns that hint into `RANDOM`. Both layouts then work through one
/// mechanism:
///
///   - plain segment: [MMapDirectory#openInput] evaluates [#READ_ADVICE] against the tagged context;
///   - compound segment: `Lucene90CompoundReader.openInput` forwards the context to
///     `IndexInput.slice(name, offset, length, context)`, which advises exactly that sub-range of the
///     shared `.cfs` mapping.
///
/// Merges keep their readahead: Lucene builds the context it reuses for
/// [org.apache.lucene.codecs.hnsw.FlatVectorsReader#getMergeInstance] before this wrapper tags
/// anything, so the merge instance re-advises without the hint and falls back to the default.
